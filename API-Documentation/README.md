## 🧱 Documentation Approach

### Structure & Consistency  
Each API is documented using a consistent format:
- **Endpoint** → **Request Schema** → **Response Schema** → **Error Codes** → **Examples**

### Principles  
- **Clear and Concise** – Easy for developers to scan and implement  
- **Complete but Lightweight** – No filler, just practical reference material  
- **Versioned and Traceable** – Designed for safe, stable integration in evolving systems

### Authoring Philosophy  
Every reference is written for real-world use—whether you're authenticating users, pulling system reports, or interacting with a generative AI model. Each section includes example payloads, edge case behavior, and links to supporting SDKs or tools where appropriate.
