## ðŸ“˜ Documentation Approach

My API documentation follows the same core principles that guide my user guides:

- **All-Encompassing** â€“ Complete coverage of endpoints, parameters, expected behaviors, and edge cases  
- **Easily Understood** â€“ Clear descriptions, real-world examples, and consistent formatting  
- **Easily Remembered** â€“ Structured documentation with patterns that developers can learn once and reuse confidently

Each reference provides what developers need to build quickly and reliablyâ€”without guessing at implementation details. My goal is to make every API call predictable, understandable, and usable in production from day one.
