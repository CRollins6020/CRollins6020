## ðŸ§  Instructional Approach  

Each module is written to accelerate learning and deepen understanding:

- **Role-Based Learning** â€“ Designed with technical and non-technical audiences in mind  
- **Modular & Reusable** â€“ Easily repurposed for onboarding tracks, LMS modules, or in-product help  
- **Task-Oriented** â€“ Shows how features solve real problems, not just how they work  
- **Grounded in Real Tools** â€“ Built using open-source or widely adopted systems like Superset, LangChain, and OpenAPI  

I write training content to enable product masteryâ€”not just task completionâ€”ensuring users build durable skills they can apply immediately and scale independently.
