## 4. Troubleshooting and support

This section provides systematic approaches to diagnosing and resolving complex administrative issues while maintaining platform stability and security.

### 4.1 Common administrative issues

Recognize and resolve frequently encountered problems using enterprise-grade diagnostic procedures and remediation strategies.

**Complex user access and permission scenarios**

**Advanced permission troubleshooting workflow:**

```mermaid

    A[User Reports Access Issue] --> B[Check User Status]
    B --> C{Account Active?}
    C -->|No| D[Check Deprovisioning Logs]
    C -->|Yes| E[Verify Permission Assignment]
    E --> F{Permissions Correct?}
    F -->|No| G[Check Group Membership]
    F -->|Yes| H[Test Authentication Flow]
    G --> I[Verify SSO Attribute Mapping]
    H --> J{Auth Successful?}

    M --> Q[Trigger Account Resync]
    N --> Q
    O --> Q
    P --> Q
    Q --> R[Validate Resolution]
```

**Multi-layered access issue resolution:**

**Problem:** Enterprise users with complex role hierarchies cannot access features despite apparent permissions

**Advanced Diagnostic Procedure:**

1. **Identity Provider Synchronization Check:**
   - Navigate to **"Security Settings"** → **"SSO Diagnostics"** → **"User Sync Status"**
   - Check if user's attributes have been updated in the identity provider within the last sync cycle
   - Verify group membership changes are reflected in the platform's role assignments
   - Review **"Sync Error Logs"** for any failures during the last synchronization process

2. **Permission Inheritance Analysis:**
   - Use **"User Management"** → **"Permission Analyzer"** to visualize the user's complete permission hierarchy
   - Check for conflicting permissions where explicit denials override inherited grants
   - Verify that environment-specific restrictions aren't blocking access to required features
   - Review any time-based access controls that may have expired or not yet activated

3. **Session and Token Validation:**
   - Check **"System Monitoring"** → **"Active Sessions"** to confirm the user has a valid, unexpired session
   - Verify JWT token claims include all necessary permission scopes
   - Test token refresh mechanism if using OAuth 2.0 flows
   - Examine API gateway logs for any authorization failures during feature access attempts

**Enterprise-specific resolution strategies:**

- **Cross-Domain Authentication Issues:** For users accessing from different domains or through VPN connections, verify that CORS policies and domain whitelisting include all necessary origins
- **Federated Identity Complexities:** When multiple identity providers are involved, check the identity federation chain and ensure proper claim transformations at each step
- **Conditional Access Policies:** Review Azure AD Conditional Access or similar policies that may be blocking access based on device compliance, location, or risk assessment

**Agent deployment and execution failures in enterprise environments**

**Complex deployment failure scenarios:**

**Problem:** Agent deployments fail intermittently across different environments with varying error messages

**Comprehensive Diagnostic Framework:**

**Infrastructure-Level Analysis:**

1. **Resource Constraint Investigation:**
   ```bash
   # Check resource utilization during failed deployments
   kubectl top nodes
   kubectl describe pod [failed-agent-pod] -n langchain-production
   kubectl get events -n langchain-production --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
   ```

2. **Network Connectivity Validation:**
   - Test connectivity to external APIs and services from agent execution environment
   - Verify DNS resolution for all external dependencies
   - Check firewall rules and security group configurations
   - Validate SSL certificate chains for HTTPS connections

3. **Container Registry and Image Issues:**
   - Verify agent container images are accessible from deployment environment
   - Check image vulnerability scan results that might block deployment
   - Validate image signatures and attestations for supply chain security
   - Review container registry authentication and access policies

**Application-Level Diagnostics:**

1. **Dependency Conflict Resolution:**
   ```python
   # Agent dependency analysis script
   import pkg_resources
   import sys
   
   def analyze_dependencies(requirements_file):
       """Analyze agent dependencies for conflicts"""
       conflicts = []
       installed = {pkg.key: pkg.version for pkg in pkg_resources.working_set}
       
       with open(requirements_file, 'r') as f:
           requirements = f.readlines()
       
       for req in requirements:
           try:
               pkg = pkg_resources.Requirement.parse(req.strip())
               if pkg.key in installed:
                   if installed[pkg.key] not in pkg:
                       conflicts.append({
                           'package': pkg.key,
                           'required': str(pkg),
                           'installed': installed[pkg.key]
                       })
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Error parsing requirement {req}: {e}")
       
       return conflicts
   ```

2. **Environment Variable and Configuration Validation:**
   - Check that all required environment variables are properly set in the deployment environment
   - Verify configuration file formats and required fields
   - Validate secrets and API keys are current and have necessary permissions
   - Test configuration against agent requirements and external service specifications

**Performance degradation analysis in enterprise deployments**

**Systematic performance investigation:**

**Problem:** Platform experiences significant performance degradation during business hours affecting multiple user groups

**Enterprise Performance Diagnostic Protocol:**

1. **Multi-Layer Performance Analysis:**

   **Database Performance Investigation:**
   ```sql
   -- PostgreSQL performance analysis queries
   SELECT 
       schemaname,
       tablename,
       attname,
       n_distinct,
       correlation
   FROM pg_stats 
   WHERE schemaname = 'langchain_production'
   ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;
   
   SELECT 
       query,
       calls,
       total_time,
       mean_time,
       rows
   FROM pg_stat_statements 
   WHERE calls > 100 
   ORDER BY total_time DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   **Application Performance Monitoring:**
   - Review APM data from tools like Datadog, New Relic, or Application Insights
   - Analyze distributed tracing data to identify bottlenecks in agent execution pipelines
   - Check garbage collection patterns and memory allocation in agent runtime environments
   - Monitor thread pool utilization and connection pool exhaustion

2. **Infrastructure Scaling Analysis:**
   - **Auto-scaling Effectiveness:** Review whether auto-scaling policies are responding appropriately to load increases
   - **Load Balancer Distribution:** Verify traffic is being distributed evenly across backend instances
   - **CDN Performance:** Check cache hit rates and origin server load for static assets
   - **Network Latency:** Measure latency between different components and external services

3. **Business Impact Assessment:**
   - Correlate performance metrics with business KPIs like user session duration and task completion rates
   - Identify which user groups and business processes are most affected by performance issues
   - Calculate estimated revenue impact and customer satisfaction effects
   - Prioritize optimization efforts based on business criticality

### 4.2 Performance diagnostics

Implement sophisticated diagnostic approaches that leverage enterprise monitoring tools and provide actionable insights for optimization.

```

**Executive escalation procedures for critical incidents:**

**SEV-1 Critical Incident Protocol:**

1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes):**
   - On-call engineer acknowledges incident and begins initial assessment
   - Incident commander assigned (platform team lead or senior engineer)
   - War room established (physical or virtual) with all key stakeholders
   - Initial impact assessment and customer notification prepared

2. **Executive Notification (15-30 minutes):**
   - CTO/VP Engineering notified with initial impact assessment
   - Customer success team alerted for proactive customer communication
   - Legal team notified if security breach or data exposure suspected
   - Public relations team prepared for potential external communication

3. **Ongoing Communication (30+ minutes):**
   - Executive briefings every 30 minutes until resolution
   - Customer communication updates every hour
   - Internal stakeholder updates via dedicated Slack channel
   - Regulatory notification if required (within applicable timeframes)

**Advanced vendor and third-party escalation**

   Why 3: Sudden spike in authentication requests exceeded capacity
   Why 4: Auto-scaling didn't activate due to misconfigured thresholds
   Why 5: Configuration change wasn't tested in staging environment
   
   Root Cause: Inadequate change management process for infrastructure configuration
   ```

3. **Contributing Factors Analysis:**
   - Technical factors (configuration, capacity, dependencies)
   - Process factors (change management, monitoring, documentation)
   - Human factors (training, communication, workload)
   - Organizational factors (priorities, resources, culture)

**Improvement Implementation Framework:**
