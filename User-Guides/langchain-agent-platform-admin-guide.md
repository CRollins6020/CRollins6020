### 5.4 Glossary

**Agent:** A configured LangChain workflow that processes inputs using AI models and tools to accomplish specific tasks

**Agent Runtime Engine:** Core platform component that executes agent workflows in isolated, scalable environments

**Authentication Provider:** External system (LDAP, SAML, OIDC) that validates user credentials and provides identity information

**Blue-Green Deployment:** Deployment strategy using two identical production environments to enable zero-downtime updates

**Circuit Breaker:** Design pattern that prevents cascading failures by monitoring and limiting calls to failing external services

**Deployment Pipeline:** Automated workflow for promoting agents from development through staging to production environments

**Embedding:** Vector representation of text data used for semantic search and retrieval augmented generation

**Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more server instances to handle increased load, as opposed to upgrading existing hardware

**LangChain:** Open-source framework for building applications with large language models and AI agents

**Load Balancing:** Distribution of network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization

**Model Provider:** External service (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI) that provides access to large language models

**Prompt Engineering:** Process of designing and optimizing text prompts to achieve desired AI model outputs

**Resource Quota:** Limits on CPU, memory, storage, or API calls allocated to users, departments, or individual agents

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Security model that grants permissions based on user roles within the organization

**Vector Store:** Specialized database for storing and querying high-dimensional embedding vectors efficiently

**Workflow:** Sequence of steps defining how an agent processes inputs, calls tools, and generates responses
