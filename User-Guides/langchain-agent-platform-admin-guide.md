## 4. Troubleshooting & support

### 4.1 Common deployment issues

**Platform won't start after installation**

This usually indicates configuration or dependency issues during the initial setup process.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Most startup failures result from incorrect environment variables, insufficient system resources, or network connectivity issues to external services.

**Solution Steps:**

**Step 1: Verify system requirements**

Check that your deployment server meets minimum requirements and has access to required external services. Confirm Docker and Docker Compose versions are compatible.

**Expected Result:** System specifications match or exceed platform requirements

**Step 2: Review configuration files**

1. Validate environment variables in `.env` file
2. Check SSL certificate paths and permissions
3. Verify database credentials and connectivity
4. Confirm model provider API keys are valid

**Expected Result:** All configuration values are properly formatted and accessible

**Step 3: Check service logs**

Review logs for each service to identify specific failure points:

```bash
# Check all service logs
docker-compose logs

# Check specific service
docker-compose logs langchain-platform
docker-compose logs postgres
docker-compose logs vector-store
```

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

- **Database connection failed:** Verify PostgreSQL container is running and credentials match
- **SSL certificate errors:** Check certificate file paths and permissions
- **Model provider timeout:** Verify API keys and network connectivity
- **Port conflicts:** Ensure configured ports are not in use by other services

**Prevention:**

Run the pre-installation system check script before deployment and maintain environment-specific configuration templates for consistent deployments.

### 4.2 Performance and scaling issues

**Agents timing out or failing under load**

Performance issues often indicate resource constraints or inefficient agent configurations affecting user experience.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Timeout failures typically result from insufficient compute resources, inefficient vector queries, or model provider rate limiting during peak usage periods.

**Solution Steps:**

**Step 1: Analyze resource utilization**

1. Review CPU and memory usage patterns in the monitoring dashboard
2. Identify resource bottlenecks during peak usage times
3. Check network latency to model providers and vector stores
4. Examine agent execution logs for performance patterns

**Expected Result:** Clear identification of performance bottlenecks and resource constraints

**Step 2: Optimize agent configurations**

1. Review agent resource allocations and increase limits if needed
2. Implement connection pooling for database and model provider connections
3. Configure query optimization for vector store operations
4. Add caching layers for frequently accessed data

**Expected Result:** Improved response times and reduced timeout failures

**Prevention:**

Implement proactive monitoring with alerts for resource thresholds and establish capacity planning procedures based on usage growth trends.

### 4.3 Security and access issues

**Users cannot access specific agents or features**

Access issues usually indicate role configuration problems or authentication integration failures requiring systematic troubleshooting.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Access problems commonly stem from incorrect role assignments, authentication provider synchronization issues, or misconfigured resource permissions.

**Solution Steps:**

**Step 1: Verify user authentication and roles**

1. Confirm user can successfully authenticate to the platform
2. Check user's assigned roles and department mappings
3. Verify role permissions match expected access levels
4. Test with a known working user account for comparison

**Expected Result:** User authentication works and role assignments are correct

**Step 2: Review resource-specific permissions**

1. Check agent-level access controls and sharing settings
2. Verify department or project-based access restrictions
3. Review any custom permission rules that might apply
4. Test access with administrative privileges to isolate permission issues

**Expected Result:** Clear understanding of permission inheritance and restrictions

**Prevention:**

Maintain documented access control procedures and conduct regular access reviews to ensure permissions remain appropriate as user responsibilities change.
