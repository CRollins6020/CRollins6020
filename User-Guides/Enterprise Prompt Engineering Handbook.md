## 9. Governance and Risk Considerations

Prompt engineering at scale must include operational and compliance guardrails:

### Prompt Metadata Schema:
| Field           | Description                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `name`          | Unique prompt identifier               |
| `author`        | Person or team who created the prompt  |
| `use_case`      | What business problem this solves      |
| `last_updated`  | Date of last revision                  |
| `expected_output_format` | JSON, list, paragraph, table     |
| `risk_level`    | Low, Medium, High                      |

### Risks to Monitor:
- Hallucinations in high-stakes scenarios (legal, medical)
- Inconsistent or offensive tone
- Prompt misuse (e.g., bypassing policy filters)

## Appendix A: Prompt Debugging Checklist

- [ ] Instruction is clear and unambiguous  
- [ ] Output format is defined (bullet list, JSON, etc.)  
- [ ] Constraints (length, tone) are explicit  
- [ ] Prompt includes relevant context or examples  
- [ ] Output is consistent across multiple runs  
- [ ] System prompt defines role or function  
- [ ] Prompt works with low temperature settings (â‰¤ 0.3)
