## 2. Prompt Design Fundamentals

![Prompt Structure Components](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181298/pexels-photo-1181298.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1000&dpr=1)

This section introduces the building blocks of well-structured prompts. The goal is to make sure every prompt has a clear purpose, expected format, and enough context to guide the model. Each component of a prompt contributes to performance—like clearly stating what the model should do, how it should respond, and what tone it should use.

### Prompt Components

| Component       | Description                      | Example                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instruction** | What the model should do         | *"Summarize this changelog in 3 bullet points."*       |
| **Input**       | The source content               | *"Product release notes, JSON error log, user email"*  |
| **Constraints** | Limits or boundaries             | *"Keep it under 75 words. Don't include pricing."*     |
| **Format**      | Expected structure of the output | *"Return a markdown table with columns: Error, Fix"*   |
| **Tone/Role**   | The model's persona or expertise | *"You are a cybersecurity SME writing to executives."* |

> **Tip:** Start with simple single-task prompts. Gradually increase complexity as you evaluate performance.

![System Configuration](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607252650355-f7fd0460ccdb?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop)

System prompts define the model's behavior, tone, and persona throughout a session. This section shows how to establish reliable defaults that improve consistency across user interactions and ensure the model acts in predictable ways.

### Example Strategies

* *"You are a professional Technical Writer working for a cybersecurity company. Be clear, concise, and use markdown formatting when appropriate."*
* *"Act as a support engineer. Be direct but friendly, avoid speculation, and cite specific logs or config settings when making recommendations."*
* *"You are a senior editor. Improve grammar and clarity while preserving meaning and tone. Do not change technical terms."*
* *"Behave as an AI assistant for developers. Return examples in JSON or code format when relevant."*
* *"You are an internal compliance specialist. Always cite the relevant policy and add a risk rating to each response."*

### Best Practices

* Keep system prompts under 1,000 characters
* Focus on behavior, tone, and constraints
* Align persona with real-world job roles
* Reinforce model limitations (e.g., avoid legal or medical advice)
* Reuse standardized system prompts across teams

![Conversation Flow](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1453738773917-9c3eff1db985?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop)

This section outlines how to structure conversations where the model and user go back and forth. Multi-turn prompts are powerful for workflows like document generation, technical troubleshooting, or iterative summaries.

### Example Workflow

**Step 1**:  
*"Summarize this SOC2 policy document in 5 bullet points."*

**Step 2**:  
*"Based on your summary, draft an FAQ for new employees about data handling."*

**Step 3**:  
*"Reformat the FAQ as a Slack message."*

### Tips

* Recap or reframe prior context
* Use follow-up instructions to refine tone or format
* Track changes explicitly (e.g., *"update last section"*)
* Acknowledge user feedback and rerun with adjustments
* Name each step for clarity in shared workflows

| Clarity   | Is the language clear and concise?       |
| Structure | Does it follow the requested format?     |
| Tone      | Is it appropriate for the audience/role? |
| Brevity   | Does it meet length constraints?         |

### Refinement Examples

**Original Prompt**:  
*"Write a summary of this user guide."*

**Refined Prompt**:  
*"Summarize the following onboarding guide into 3 plain-language bullet points focused on setup steps. Keep it under 100 words."*

**Original Prompt**:  
*"Explain this config."*

**Refined Prompt**:  
*"You are a DevOps specialist. Describe the function of this YAML configuration file using bullet points. Mention environment settings, ports, and volumes."*

**Original Prompt**:  
*"What do you think?"*

**Refined Prompt**:  
*"Critically evaluate the pros and cons of the password policy described below. Return a markdown table with two columns: Strengths and Weaknesses."*

![Risk Management Framework](https://images.pexels.com/photos/6693661/pexels-photo-6693661.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1000&dpr=1)

To scale prompt usage safely across teams, you need structure and oversight. This section defines how to document, review, and audit prompts so that they align with enterprise risk management.

### Metadata Tracking

Use metadata to document the who, what, why, and how of each enterprise-level prompt. Metadata enables traceability, risk monitoring, and reuse.

| Prompt Name           | Author     | Business Purpose          | Format      | Last Reviewed | Sensitivity |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| onboarding\_faq\_v2   | K. Bennett | Internal training guide   | Bullet List | 2024-11-03    | Low         |
| risk\_eval\_prompt\_1 | J. Owens   | Vulnerability scoring     | JSON        | 2025-01-15    | High        |
| product\_pitch\_Q2    | M. Chang   | Sales enablement email    | Paragraph   | 2025-03-05    | Medium      |
| triage\_script\_gen   | R. Ortega  | Ticket routing in support | Table       | 2025-02-12    | Medium      |
| exec\_summary\_tool   | A. Rollins | Quarterly board summary   | Prose       | 2025-04-01    | Low         |

### Risks to Monitor

* Hallucinations in legal, compliance, or security tasks
* Overgeneralized answers without sufficient constraints
* Format drift over time in shared use prompts

> **Governance Tip**: Store reusable prompts in a version-controlled knowledge base or Git repo. Add unit tests where possible.
