## 1. Introduction

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear, structured instructions to get accurate, repeatable responses from large language models (LLMs). In an enterprise context, effective prompts power documentation, enablement, customer support, and product integration workflows across technical and business domains.

This guide helps Technical Writers, Enablement teams, and SMEs write better prompts using structured frameworks, real-world examples, and best practices tailored to SaaS, cybersecurity, and high-tech use cases.

## 2. Prompt Design Fundamentals

Great prompts are:

* **Purposeful**: Targeting a specific task or outcome
* **Structured**: Defining clear output formats
* **Contextual**: Including relevant input and scope
* **Constrained**: Limiting length, tone, or vocabulary
* **Role-specific**: Defining the AI's perspective or expertise

### Prompt Components

| Component       | Description                      | Example                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instruction** | What the model should do         | *"Summarize this changelog in 3 bullet points."*       |
| **Input**       | The source content               | *"Product release notes, JSON error log, user email"*  |
| **Constraints** | Limits or boundaries             | *"Keep it under 75 words. Don’t include pricing."*     |
| **Format**      | Expected structure of the output | *"Return a markdown table with columns: Error, Fix"*   |
| **Tone/Role**   | The model’s persona or expertise | *"You are a cybersecurity SME writing to executives."* |

> **Tip:** Start with simple single-task prompts. Gradually increase complexity as you evaluate performance.

### Stylized Example

> **✅ Good Prompt**
> *"You are a Technical Writer. Review the product changelog below and summarize the top 3 user-facing changes. Return your answer as a bullet list using plain language."*
>
> **🚫 Bad Prompt**
> *"Summarize the changelog."*

## 3. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                    | Cause                       | Fix                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Vague Instructions         | Ambiguous verbs or goals    | Use direct, specific tasks                |
| Inconsistent Output        | No format defined           | Specify structure and constraints         |
| Hallucinations             | Lack of context or examples | Include source data and lower temperature |
| Overloaded Prompts         | Too many requests at once   | Break into smaller, sequential prompts    |
| Loss of Multi-Turn Context | Insufficient memory cues    | Recap prior steps; restate relevant input |

---

## 4. System Prompt Strategies

System prompts influence the model’s behavior across a session.

### Example Strategies

> *"You are a professional Technical Writer working for a cybersecurity company. Be clear, concise, and use markdown formatting when appropriate."*

> *"Act as a support engineer. Be direct but friendly, avoid speculation, and cite specific logs or config settings when making recommendations."*

### Best Practices

* Keep system prompts under 1,000 characters
* Focus on behavior, tone, and constraints
* Use system prompts for persona alignment, not task logic

## 5. Role-Based Prompting Patterns

| Role                      | Prompt Pattern                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Writer**      | *"Convert this Slack thread into a formal internal SOP. Use headers and bullets."*              |
| **Support Engineer**      | *"Review this error trace and suggest 3 likely causes. Include one diagnostic step per cause."* |
| **Sales Enablement**      | *"Write a 1-paragraph pitch for this new feature targeting IT security leaders."*               |
| **Product Manager**       | *"Summarize this customer feedback into 3 prioritized feature requests."*                       |
| **Cybersecurity Analyst** | *"Assess this firewall rule for potential vulnerabilities. Return risk level and reasoning."*   |

## 6. Multi-Turn Interactions

Use multi-step prompts to build complex tasks with memory.

### Example Workflow

> **Step 1:** *"Summarize this SOC2 policy document in 5 bullet points."*
> **Step 2:** *"Based on your summary, draft an FAQ for new employees about data handling."*
> **Step 3:** *"Reformat the FAQ as a Slack message."*

### Tips

* Recap or reframe prior context
* Use follow-up instructions to refine tone or format
* Track changes explicitly (e.g., "update last section")

## 7. Evaluation and Refinement Techniques

### How to Evaluate Outputs

| Criterion | Questions to Ask                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy  | Are facts consistent with the input?     |
| Clarity   | Is the language clear and concise?       |
| Structure | Does it follow the requested format?     |
| Tone      | Is it appropriate for the audience/role? |
| Brevity   | Does it meet length constraints?         |

### Refinement Tips

> **Original Prompt:** *"Write a summary of this user guide."*
> **Refined Prompt:** *"Summarize the following onboarding guide into 3 plain-language bullet points focused on setup steps. Keep it under 100 words."*

## 8. Use Case Templates

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Summary

> *"You are a Tier 2 support engineer. Review the error log below and summarize the root cause and recommended fix. Return as a 2-bullet list."*

### 🔐 Security Risk Review

> *"You are a cybersecurity analyst. Analyze the attached firewall configuration and list 3 risks. Assign a severity level to each and explain why."*

### 📈 Reporting Summary

> *"You are a Technical Writer. Summarize the quarterly product metrics into a stakeholder-friendly format. Highlight usage trends and churn indicators."*

### 📬 Outbound Enablement Copy

> *"Write a short, punchy paragraph introducing this new feature to sales reps. Include one benefit and a call to action."*

### 📚 Internal FAQ Generator

> *"Based on the product spec below, generate an internal FAQ for Customer Success. Focus on integration, known issues, and licensing."*

## 9. Governance and Risk Considerations

Prompt engineering in enterprise contexts requires process rigor:

### Metadata Tracking

| Field            | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Prompt Name      | Unique identifier                           |
| Author           | Who created or approved it                  |
| Business Purpose | Use case (e.g., support triage, onboarding) |
| Format Type      | Bullet, table, JSON, prose                  |
| Last Reviewed    | Date of last QA/test                        |
| Sensitivity      | Risk level (Low, Medium, High)              |

### Risks to Monitor

* **Hallucinations** in legal, compliance, or security tasks
* **Overgeneralized answers** without sufficient constraints
* **Format drift** over time in shared use prompts

> **Governance Tip:** Store reusable prompts in a version-controlled knowledge base or Git repo. Add unit tests where possible.

## Appendix A: Prompt Debugging Checklist

Use this checklist when testing or evaluating a prompt:

* [ ] Is the **task instruction** specific and clear?
* [ ] Is the **input** well-scoped and available?
* [ ] Are **constraints** like tone, length, or exclusions defined?
* [ ] Is the **output format** described (e.g., bullets, JSON)?
* [ ] Does the **system prompt** define behavior or persona?
* [ ] Have you tested the prompt with **different inputs**?
* [ ] Is the output **consistent** across runs at low temperature?
* [ ] Are there **fallbacks** or clarifications for edge cases?
* [ ] Does the result follow all **style and formatting rules**?
* [ ] Are there **any hallucinations** or unsupported statements?

> ✅ Aim for consistency, clarity, and repeatability. Prompts should perform reliably across runs and users.
