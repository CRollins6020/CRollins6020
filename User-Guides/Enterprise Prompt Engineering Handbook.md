## 2. Prompt Design Fundamentals

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Prompt Components"
        A[Instruction]
        B[Input]
        C[Constraints]
        D[Format]
        E[Tone/Role]
    end
    
    subgraph "Example Structure"
        F["You are a {ROLE}.
           {INSTRUCTION} based on the {INPUT}.
           {CONSTRAINTS}.
           Return as {FORMAT}."]
    end
    
    A & B & C & D & E --> F
    F --> G[Complete Prompt]
```

This section introduces the building blocks of well-structured prompts. The goal is to make sure every prompt has a clear purpose, expected format, and enough context to guide the model. Each component of a prompt contributes to performance—like clearly stating what the model should do, how it should respond, and what tone it should use.

### Prompt Components

| Component       | Description                      | Example                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instruction** | What the model should do         | *"Summarize this changelog in 3 bullet points."*       |
| **Input**       | The source content               | *"Product release notes, JSON error log, user email"*  |
| **Constraints** | Limits or boundaries             | *"Keep it under 75 words. Don't include pricing."*     |
| **Format**      | Expected structure of the output | *"Return a markdown table with columns: Error, Fix"*   |
| **Tone/Role**   | The model's persona or expertise | *"You are a cybersecurity SME writing to executives."* |

> **Tip:** Start with simple single-task prompts. Gradually increase complexity as you evaluate performance.

## 4. System Prompt Strategies

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Prompt] --> B[Role Definition]
    A --> C[Behavior Rules]
    A --> D[Tone Guidelines]
    A --> E[Format Preferences]
    A --> F[Constraints]
    
    subgraph "Example Structure"
        G["You are a {PROFESSIONAL ROLE}.
        
        Your task is to {MAIN FUNCTION}.
        
        Follow these guidelines:
        - {BEHAVIOR RULE 1}
        - {BEHAVIOR RULE 2}
        - {BEHAVIOR RULE 3}
        
        Use {TONE} and {STYLE}."]
    end
    
    B & C & D & E & F --> G
```

System prompts define the model's behavior, tone, and persona throughout a session. This section shows how to establish reliable defaults that improve consistency across user interactions and ensure the model acts in predictable ways.

### Example Strategies

* *"You are a professional Technical Writer working for a cybersecurity company. Be clear, concise, and use markdown formatting when appropriate."*
* *"Act as a support engineer. Be direct but friendly, avoid speculation, and cite specific logs or config settings when making recommendations."*
* *"You are a senior editor. Improve grammar and clarity while preserving meaning and tone. Do not change technical terms."*
* *"Behave as an AI assistant for developers. Return examples in JSON or code format when relevant."*
* *"You are an internal compliance specialist. Always cite the relevant policy and add a risk rating to each response."*

### Best Practices

* Keep system prompts under 1,000 characters
* Focus on behavior, tone, and constraints
* Align persona with real-world job roles
* Reinforce model limitations (e.g., avoid legal or medical advice)
* Reuse standardized system prompts across teams

## 5. Role-Based Prompting Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Enterprise Roles"
        A[Technical Writer] -->|Documentation| B["Convert this {SOURCE} into {FORMAT}.
                                                Use {STYLE} with {ELEMENTS}."]
        
        C[Support Engineer] -->|Troubleshooting| D["Review this {ERROR_SOURCE} and
                                                    identify {NUMBER} likely causes.
                                                    Include {SOLUTION_TYPE} per cause."]
        
        E[Product Manager] -->|Requirements| F["Summarize this {FEEDBACK} into
                                                {NUMBER} prioritized items.
                                                Focus on {CRITERIA}."]
        
        G[Security Analyst] -->|Risk Assessment| H["Evaluate this {ASSET} for vulnerabilities.
                                                   Return {FORMAT} with {ELEMENTS}."]
    end
```

Different business roles require different prompt patterns. This section gives reusable templates aligned to job functions. These patterns ensure that prompts reflect actual workplace needs and communication styles.

| Role                      | Prompt Pattern                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Writer**      | *"Convert this Slack thread into a formal internal SOP. Use headers and bullets."*              |
| **Support Engineer**      | *"Review this error trace and suggest 3 likely causes. Include one diagnostic step per cause."* |
| **Sales Enablement**      | *"Write a 1-paragraph pitch for this new feature targeting IT security leaders."*               |
| **Product Manager**       | *"Summarize this customer feedback into 3 prioritized feature requests."*                       |
| **Cybersecurity Analyst** | *"Assess this firewall rule for potential vulnerabilities. Return risk level and reasoning."*   |

## 6. Multi-Turn Interactions

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant LLM
    
    User->>LLM: Initial prompt with task
    LLM->>User: First response
    
    User->>LLM: Refinement request
    Note over User,LLM: "Make it more concise"
    LLM->>User: Refined response
    
    User->>LLM: Format modification
    Note over User,LLM: "Put this in a table"
    LLM->>User: Reformatted response
    
    User->>LLM: Additional request
    Note over User,LLM: "Add section about X"
    LLM->>User: Complete response
```

This section outlines how to structure conversations where the model and user go back and forth. Multi-turn prompts are powerful for workflows like document generation, technical troubleshooting, or iterative summaries.

### Example Workflow

**Step 1**:  
*"Summarize this SOC2 policy document in 5 bullet points."*

**Step 2**:  
*"Based on your summary, draft an FAQ for new employees about data handling."*

**Step 3**:  
*"Reformat the FAQ as a Slack message."*

### Tips

* Recap or reframe prior context
* Use follow-up instructions to refine tone or format
* Track changes explicitly (e.g., *"update last section"*)
* Acknowledge user feedback and rerun with adjustments
* Name each step for clarity in shared workflows

    D --> E{Meets Criteria?}
    
    E -->|No| F[Identify Issues]
    F --> G[Refine Prompt]
    G --> C
    
    E -->|Yes| H[Document Success]
    H --> I[Standardize Pattern]
    
    subgraph "Evaluation Criteria"
        J[Accuracy]
        K[Clarity]
        L[Structure]
        M[Tone]
        N[Brevity]
    end
    
    D --- J & K & L & M & N
```

This section provides criteria and examples for reviewing prompt outputs and iteratively improving prompts based on outcomes. Evaluation helps ensure outputs are accurate, clear, and fit for purpose.

### How to Evaluate Outputs

| Criterion | Questions to Ask                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy  | Are facts consistent with the input?     |
| Clarity   | Is the language clear and concise?       |
| Structure | Does it follow the requested format?     |
| Tone      | Is it appropriate for the audience/role? |
| Brevity   | Does it meet length constraints?         |

### Refinement Examples

**Original Prompt**:  
*"Write a summary of this user guide."*

**Refined Prompt**:  
*"Summarize the following onboarding guide into 3 plain-language bullet points focused on setup steps. Keep it under 100 words."*

**Original Prompt**:  
*"Explain this config."*

**Refined Prompt**:  
*"You are a DevOps specialist. Describe the function of this YAML configuration file using bullet points. Mention environment settings, ports, and volumes."*

**Original Prompt**:  
*"What do you think?"*

**Refined Prompt**:  
*"Critically evaluate the pros and cons of the password policy described below. Return a markdown table with two columns: Strengths and Weaknesses."*

        P[Regulatory Concerns]
        Q[Data Privacy Issues]
    end
    
    C --- M & N & O & P & Q
```

To scale prompt usage safely across teams, you need structure and oversight. This section defines how to document, review, and audit prompts so that they align with enterprise risk management.

### Metadata Tracking

Use metadata to document the who, what, why, and how of each enterprise-level prompt. Metadata enables traceability, risk monitoring, and reuse.

| Prompt Name           | Author     | Business Purpose          | Format      | Last Reviewed | Sensitivity |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| onboarding\_faq\_v2   | K. Bennett | Internal training guide   | Bullet List | 2024-11-03    | Low         |
| risk\_eval\_prompt\_1 | J. Owens   | Vulnerability scoring     | JSON        | 2025-01-15    | High        |
| product\_pitch\_Q2    | M. Chang   | Sales enablement email    | Paragraph   | 2025-03-05    | Medium      |
| triage\_script\_gen   | R. Ortega  | Ticket routing in support | Table       | 2025-02-12    | Medium      |
| exec\_summary\_tool   | A. Rollins | Quarterly board summary   | Prose       | 2025-04-01    | Low         |

### Risks to Monitor

* Hallucinations in legal, compliance, or security tasks
* Overgeneralized answers without sufficient constraints
* Format drift over time in shared use prompts

> **Governance Tip**: Store reusable prompts in a version-controlled knowledge base or Git repo. Add unit tests where possible.

```

This checklist is for debugging and validating prompts before deployment or reuse. Use it during QA or prompt development sessions to ensure quality.

* [ ] Is the **task instruction** specific and clear?
* [ ] Is the **input** well-scoped and available?
* [ ] Are **constraints** like tone, length, or exclusions defined?
* [ ] Is the **output format** described (e.g., bullets, JSON)?
* [ ] Does the **system prompt** define behavior or persona?
* [ ] Have you tested the prompt with **different inputs**?
* [ ] Is the output **consistent** across runs at low temperature?
* [ ] Are there **fallbacks** or clarifications for edge cases?
* [ ] Does the result follow all **style and formatting rules**?
* [ ] Are there **any hallucinations** or unsupported statements?

> ✅ Aim for consistency, clarity, and repeatability. Prompts should perform reliably across runs and users.
