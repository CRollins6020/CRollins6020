## 2. Prompt Design Fundamentals

| Component       | Description                              | Example                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Instruction** | What the model should do                 | “Summarize this text in 3 bullet points.”            |
| **Input**       | The source content                       | “Customer chat log, JSON payload, markdown document” |
| **Constraints** | Limits or boundaries                     | “Use no more than 150 words. Exclude pricing details.” |
| **Format**      | Expected structure of the output         | “Respond in markdown table format with 3 columns.”   |
| **Tone/Role**   | The model’s persona or perspective       | “You are a professional cybersecurity analyst.”      |

> **Example Prompt**: You are a senior data analyst. Summarize the customer churn report below in three key findings. Respond with a numbered list and no more than 75 words.
