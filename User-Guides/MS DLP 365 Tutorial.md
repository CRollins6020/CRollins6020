### Step 5: Define policy settings

1. Configure policy settings by choosing a protection level:
   - **Low**: Detects large numbers of sensitive information (e.g., 10+ credit card numbers)
   - **Medium**: Detects moderate numbers (e.g., 5-9 credit card numbers)
   - **High**: Detects even a single instance of sensitive information

2. For this tutorial, select **High** protection
3. Click **Next**

## Configuring Policy Settings

### Step 1: Configure policy tips

Policy tips are notifications that appear to users when they're about to violate a policy.

1. Under the **Policy tips** section, check **Show policy tips to users and admins**
2. Customize the tip text if desired (e.g., "This document contains credit card information. Please verify you are authorized to share this data.")
3. Click **Next**

![Policy tip configuration screen](https://example.com/placeholder-for-policy-tips.png)

### Step 2: Set up notifications

1. Under **Notifications**, configure who should be notified when the policy is triggered:
   - Check **Send an email alert to admins**
   - Add email addresses for your security team or administrators

2. Optional: Configure incident reports to be sent to specific individuals
3. Click **Next**

### Step 3: Configure actions for different conditions

1. For **High confidence detection of credit card numbers**, set these actions:
   - **Block access** to the content
   - **Require justification** if a user needs to override the block
   - **Send notification** to the user

2. For **Low/Medium confidence detection**, set more lenient actions:
   - **Send notification** to the user
   - Do not block access, but **log the activity**

3. Click **Next**

### Step 4: Review your policy

1. Review all settings to ensure they match your requirements
2. If changes are needed, use the **Back** button to navigate to the appropriate section
3. When satisfied with all settings, click **Submit**

### Step 5: Choose policy mode

1. Select one of the following options:
   - **Turn on the policy right away** - Applies policy immediately
   - **Test it out first** - Runs in simulation mode without enforcing actions (recommended)

2. For this tutorial, select **Test it out first**
3. Click **Next** and then **Done**

## Testing Your DLP Policy

### Step 1: Create a test document with sample data

1. Open Microsoft Word or Excel
2. Create a new document
3. Add sample credit card numbers (e.g., "4111 1111 1111 1111" - a test Visa number)
4. Save the document to OneDrive or SharePoint

> **Note:** Never use real credit card numbers, even for testing. Use publicly available test numbers instead.

### Step 2: Attempt to share the document

1. Try to share the document with someone outside your organization
2. Observe the policy tip that appears warning about sensitive content
3. Note how the system responds based on your policy configuration

![Example of a policy tip displayed to a user](https://example.com/placeholder-for-policy-tip-example.png)

### Step 3: Check for admin notifications

1. Verify that the configured administrators received alert emails
2. Review the alert content to ensure it contains the expected information

### Step 4: Test policy overrides (if configured)

1. Attempt to override the policy by providing a business justification
2. Verify that the override is properly logged for review

## Monitoring and Fine-Tuning

### Step 1: Access DLP reports

1. In the Microsoft 365 Compliance center, navigate to **Reports**
2. Select **Data loss prevention**
3. Review the available reports to monitor policy effectiveness

![DLP reports dashboard](https://example.com/placeholder-for-dlp-reports.png)

### Step 2: Analyze policy matches

1. Review the **DLP policy matches** report
2. Look for:
   - Which policies are being triggered most frequently
   - Which locations (email, SharePoint, etc.) have the most matches
   - Which users are frequently triggering policies

2. Use this information to identify potential areas for policy refinement

### Step 3: Check for false positives

1. Review incidents that might be false positives
2. Look for patterns that could indicate the policy is too sensitive
3. Consider excluding certain false-positive patterns using exceptions

### Step 4: Refine your policy

1. Navigate to **Data loss prevention > Policies**
2. Select your policy and click **Edit policy**
3. Make adjustments based on your findings:
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Add exceptions for specific scenarios
   - Modify actions if they're too restrictive or not restrictive enough

4. Save your changes

![Policy editing screen](https://example.com/placeholder-for-policy-editing.png)

### Step 5: Turn on the policy in enforcement mode

Once you're satisfied with your testing:

1. Navigate to **Data loss prevention > Policies**
2. Select your policy and click **Edit policy**
3. Change the policy mode from **Test** to **On**
4. Click **Save**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Policy Not Triggering as Expected

**Symptoms:** Sensitive content is not being detected despite matching the criteria.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Verify the policy is in enforcement mode, not test mode
2. Check that the locations where the content exists are included in the policy scope
3. Confirm the content contains enough instances of sensitive information to trigger the policy
4. Ensure the content format is supported for scanning (some image formats may not be scanned)

### Users Not Seeing Policy Tips

**Symptoms:** Policy violations occur, but users don't see notification tips.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Verify policy tips are enabled in the policy configuration
2. Check that the user's application supports policy tips (supported in Office applications and web apps)
3. Ensure the user is signed in with their Microsoft 365 account
4. Try clearing the browser cache or restarting the application

### Too Many False Positives

**Symptoms:** Policy frequently triggers on content that doesn't actually contain sensitive information.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Adjust the confidence level threshold
2. Add exceptions for specific patterns that are triggering falsely
3. Create a custom sensitive information type with more specific detection patterns
4. Use advanced DLP rules with additional conditions to increase accuracy

### Policy Blocks Legitimate Business Activities

**Symptoms:** Users are unable to perform necessary tasks due to DLP blocks.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Implement a business justification process for overrides
2. Create exceptions for specific teams or departments that legitimately work with sensitive data
3. Consider using less restrictive actions (alert instead of block) for certain user groups
4. Configure time-limited policy overrides for special projects

## Best Practices

### Policy Design

- **Start narrow and expand**: Begin with protecting your most critical data types
- **Use test mode**: Always test policies before full enforcement
- **Layer policies**: Create separate policies for different data types rather than one complex policy
- **Document exceptions**: Maintain clear records of any exceptions and their justifications

### User Communication

- **Inform users before enforcement**: Send communications about new DLP policies before turning them on
- **Provide clear guidance**: Create user-friendly documentation about the policies
- **Offer training**: Help users understand how to work securely with sensitive data
- **Gather feedback**: Create a channel for users to report issues with DLP policies

### Ongoing Management

- **Regular reviews**: Schedule quarterly reviews of DLP effectiveness
- **Update for new threats**: Regularly update policies as new risk patterns emerge
- **Monitor exceptions**: Regularly review override justifications to identify trends
- **Compliance alignment**: Ensure policies stay aligned with changing regulations

### Integration with Other Security Tools

- **Combine with sensitivity labels**: Use with Microsoft Information Protection for comprehensive data security
- **Endpoint protection**: Consider integrating with endpoint DLP for complete coverage
- **Third-party tools**: Evaluate how DLP interacts with other security solutions in your environment
- **Automated remediation**: Consider setting up Power Automate flows for automated remediation of certain violations
