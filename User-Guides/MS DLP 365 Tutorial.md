## 📘 Introduction

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) helps you identify, monitor, and protect sensitive information across Microsoft 365—emails, documents, and chat messages.

### 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

- Create a DLP policy to protect sensitive data
- Configure alerts, actions, and policy tips
- Test your DLP configuration safely
- Monitor policy performance and refine over time

### Common Use Cases

- Prevent credit card data from being shared externally  
- Detect outbound emails with Social Security Numbers  
- Alert admins about unauthorized access to financial records  
- Block the sharing of PHI to comply with HIPAA

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Admin Role**: Global, Security, or Compliance Administrator  
- **Planning**: Know what data types you want to protect  
- **Browser**: Use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome

- Add relevant emails (e.g., security team)

Optionally configure incident reports  
Click **Next**

---

### Step 3: Set Actions Based on Confidence

For **High confidence** detection:

- Block access  
- Require justification for overrides  
- Send user notification  

For **Low/Medium**:

- Send notification only  
- Log event, no block

Click **Next**

## 🧪 Testing Your DLP Policy

### Step 1: Create Test Document

- Open Word/Excel  
- Add test credit card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`  
- Save to OneDrive or SharePoint  

> ⚠️ Use **test numbers only**—never real credit cards.

---

### Step 2: Try Sharing the Document

- Share with an external address  
- Look for the policy tip

---

### Step 3: Check Admin Notifications

- Confirm alert emails were sent  
- Review the details and triggers

---

### Step 4: Test Override (if enabled)

- Enter a justification and override the policy  
- Confirm event is logged

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Fine-Tuning

### Step 1: Access Reports

- Go to **Compliance Center > Reports > Data loss prevention**

**🖼️ Screenshot: DLP reporting dashboard**

---

### Step 2: Review Policy Matches

- See which policies and users trigger alerts  
- Identify top data loss locations

---

### Step 3: Identify False Positives

- Review false matches  
- Look for patterns to exclude

---

### Step 4: Refine Your Policy

1. Go to **DLP > Policies**  
2. Click **Edit policy**  
3. Adjust:
   - Thresholds
   - Exceptions
   - Actions

## 🧰 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❌ Policy Not Triggering

- Verify it's not in **test mode**  
- Check location scope  
- Make sure data quantity meets detection threshold  
- Confirm supported content format

---

### 🧩 Policy Tip Missing

- Ensure tips are enabled  
- Check app/browser compatibility  
- Confirm user is signed into Microsoft 365  
- Clear browser cache

---

### 🚨 Too Many False Positives

- Adjust detection thresholds  
- Add exceptions for common false triggers  
- Create custom sensitivity patterns  
- Use advanced conditions

---

### 🔒 Policy Blocking Legitimate Work

- Enable justifications  
- Add group-based exceptions  
- Switch to **notify-only** for some users  
- Use time-limited overrides

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### Design

- Start small, expand gradually  
- Always test before enforcing  
- Separate policies by data type  
- Document all exceptions

---

### User Enablement

- Pre-announce changes  
- Provide user guidance  
- Offer training resources  
- Collect feedback

---

### Maintenance

- Quarterly policy reviews  
- Adjust for new threats  
- Monitor override logs  
- Stay aligned with regulations

---

### Integration

- Combine with sensitivity labels  
- Use endpoint DLP where needed  
- Consider third-party tool compatibility  
- Automate via Power Automate when applicable
