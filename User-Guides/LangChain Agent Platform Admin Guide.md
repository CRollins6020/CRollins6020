  - name: "us-east"
    primary: true
    database:
      host: "postgres-us-east.internal"
    cache:
      host: "redis-us-east.internal"
      
  - name: "eu-west"
    database:
      host: "postgres-eu-west.internal"
    cache:
      host: "redis-eu-west.internal"
    compliance:
      dataResidency: "EU"
```

#### Custom LLM Routing

Configure intelligent routing between different LLM providers:

```yaml
llmRouter:
  enabled: true
  rules:
    - name: "cost-optimization"
      condition: "character_count < 500 AND priority != high"
      provider: "openai"
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
      
    - name: "high-quality"
      condition: "priority = high OR contains_sensitive_data = true"
      provider: "anthropic"
      model: "claude-3-opus"
      
    - name: "fallback"
      condition: "default"
      provider: "openai"
      model: "gpt-4"
```

| Configuration Backup | After changes | Export to version control |
| System Updates | Monthly | Apply security updates |
| Platform Updates | Quarterly | Update to latest stable release |

#### Update Process

Follow this process for platform updates:

1. **Pre-Update Checks**:
   - Review release notes for breaking changes
   - Backup configuration and database
   - Verify system meets new requirements

2. **Update Procedure**:
   ```bash
   # For Kubernetes deployments
   helm repo update
   helm upgrade langchain-agents langchain/agent-platform \
     --namespace langchain \
     --values values.yaml \
     --version x.y.z
   
   # For Docker Compose deployments
   cd agent-platform
   git pull
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Post-Update Verification**:
   - Check service status
   - Verify agent functionality
   - Validate integrations
   - Run health checks

#### Backup and Recovery

Implement a comprehensive backup strategy:

```yaml
# Backup configuration
backup:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
  
  targets:
    - type: "database"
      provider: "postgres"
      retentionDays: 30
      
    - type: "configuration"
      destination: "s3://backups-bucket/langchain/config/"
      retentionDays: 90
      
    - type: "vector-database"
      provider: "pinecone"
      retentionDays: 14
```

Recovery procedures should be documented and tested periodically:

1. **Database Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Example PostgreSQL recovery
   pg_restore -h [host] -U [username] -d langchain -c /path/to/backup.dump
   ```

2. **Configuration Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Example configuration restoration
   kubectl create configmap langchain-config --from-file=/path/to/config.yaml -n langchain
   kubectl rollout restart deployment langchain-api -n langchain
   ```

3. **Full Platform Recovery**:
   - Follow installation procedure with backed-up configurations
   - Restore database from latest backup
   - Verify system integrity

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Always test recovery procedures in a non-production environment first to ensure they work as expected.

### Health Checks and Alerting

Configure comprehensive health monitoring:

#### Health Check Endpoints

The platform provides these health check endpoints:

- `/health/live`: Basic liveness check
- `/health/ready`: Readiness check including dependencies
- `/health/system`: Detailed system health status
- `/health/integrations`: Integration connectivity status

#### Alerting Configuration

Set up alerts for critical conditions:

```yaml
# Alerting configuration
alerts:
  channels:
    - type: "email"
      recipients: ["ops-team@company.com"]
      
    - type: "slack"
      webhook: "${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}"
      channel: "#langchain-alerts"
      
    - type: "pagerduty"
      routingKey: "${PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY}"
      severity: "critical"
  
  rules:
    - name: "SystemDown"
      condition: "health.status != 'UP' for 5m"
      channels: ["slack", "pagerduty"]
      message: "LangChain system is down or degraded"
      
    - name: "HighTokenUsage"
      condition: "rate(token_usage_total[1h]) > 100000"
      channels: ["email", "slack"]
      message: "Token usage exceeding normal thresholds"
      
    - name: "DatabaseConnectionIssues"
      condition: "database_connection_errors > 5 for 2m"
      channels: ["slack", "pagerduty"]
      message: "Database connectivity problems detected"
