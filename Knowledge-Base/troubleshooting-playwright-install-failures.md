## üîç Symptoms and Common Errors

| Error Message                                     | Likely Cause                               | Recommended Fix                             |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT` during install         | Network issue or proxy/firewall interference| Use `--ignore-scripts`, whitelist domains    |
| `EACCES: permission denied`                      | No write access to install directory        | Use `nvm`, install globally with sudo        |
| `Cannot find module 'playwright'` after install  | Incomplete install or corrupted node_modules| Clear cache and reinstall                   |
| `playwright install` hangs                       | CDN or GitHub artifact fetch stuck          | Use mirror URL or local cache fallback       |

## üîß Pre-checks Before Installing

- ‚úÖ Use a supported Node.js version (`>= 16.x`)  
- ‚úÖ Clean project with no partially installed modules  
- ‚úÖ Admin/owner rights for system-level installs  
- ‚úÖ Access to required domains:
  - `https://playwright.azureedge.net`
  - `https://github.com/microsoft/playwright`

---

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Fixes

### 1. Clean and Reinstall

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npx playwright install
```

---

### 2. Use a Custom CDN Mirror

```bash
PUPPETEER_DOWNLOAD_HOST=https://playwright.azureedge.net   npm install @playwright/test
```

üí° You can also set this in `.npmrc` for CI environments.

---

### 3. Isolate with nvm and Retry

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
npm install -g @playwright/test
```

‚úÖ Use per-user environments to avoid global permission issues.

---

### 4. Bypass Network Constraints (Airgapped/Proxy)

```bash
npx playwright install --ignore-scripts
```

- Manually download browser binaries from GitHub  
- Use `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` to set custom binary path

---

## üßØ Example Case: Permission Denied on macOS

**Error:**
```bash
EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'
```

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules
npm install -g @playwright/test
```
