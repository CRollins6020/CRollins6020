## 3. Root Causes and Fixes

### 3.1 Fixing Permissions (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Reset permissions on the Playwright browser cache
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.cache/ms-playwright
```

### 3.2 For Corporate Proxies or Firewalls

Set your proxy in the terminal:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

Or use `.npmrc`:

```
https-proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

### 3.3 Fix Corrupted or Incomplete Downloads

Clear the Playwright cache and reinstall:

```bash
# Clear any incomplete binary downloads
rm -rf ~/.cache/ms-playwright

# Reinstall with fresh download
npx playwright install
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Ensure you‚Äôre not behind a VPN or captive Wi-Fi portal that could block downloads.

### 3.4 Windows-Specific Fixes

If encountering `spawn UNKNOWN`:

- Run terminal as **Administrator**
- Confirm `powershell` is in your system `PATH`
- Reinstall dependencies:

```powershell
# Clean and reinstall Playwright dependencies
npm ci
npx playwright install
```

## 4. Advanced Debugging

Enable verbose logging to reveal internal installation steps:

```bash
DEBUG=pw:install npx playwright install
```

Check network access:

```bash
curl https://playwright.azureedge.net
```

Verify your environment:

```bash
npx envinfo --binaries --system --npmPackages playwright
```

üí° **Tip:** Use [Playwright Docker images](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker) for clean installs in CI.
