# Technical Writing & Instructional Design Portfolio

**Hi there ‚Äî and welcome.**

This is my technical documentation portfolio, a space I use to practice Technical Writing as I continue to self-teach and grow in the field. I‚Äôve included sample docs that reflect how I approach making complex topics more clear and approachable. My background is in SaaS enablement, where I worked as a Senior Instructional Designer, and I‚Äôm now shifting into Technical Writing with a focus on clarity, usability, and real-world impact.

## üìÇ Portfolio Contents

Here, you'll find examples of my work across several documentation types, including:

- **User Guides & Tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions for technical products
- **API Documentation**: Clear reference documentation for developers
- **Knowledge Base Articles**: Concise solutions to common technical problems
- **Training Materials**: Educational content for technical product users

Each folder contains examples that demonstrate different documentation styles and approaches. All samples reflect my experience creating technical enablement content that improves user adoption and reduces support needs.

## üîç About These Samples

The documents in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to:

- Organize complex information in a user-friendly way
