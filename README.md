# Hello, I'm Corey Rollins üëã

I'm a Senior Instructional Designer with extensive experience in SaaS enablement, currently exploring technical writing and documentation. I excel at transforming complex technical concepts into clear, accessible content that helps users navigate technology with confidence.

## What You'll Find Here

My GitHub houses my **Technical Writing Portfolio**, where I practice and showcase documentation skills through various sample projects. This portfolio reflects my approach to creating clear, user-focused documentation.

### Portfolio Highlights

- [**User Guides & Tutorials**](./CRollins6020/User-Guides) - Comprehensive documentation for technical products
- [**API Documentation**](./CRollins6020/API-Documentation) - Clear reference materials for developers
- [**Knowledge Base Articles**](./CRollins6020/Knowledge-Base) - Troubleshooting and how-to resources
- [**Training Materials**](./CRollins6020/Training-Materials) - Educational content for product users

I'm particularly interested in documentation-as-code practices and creating developer-friendly content.
