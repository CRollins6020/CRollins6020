# Technical Writing & Instructional Design Portfolio

**Hi there ‚Äî and welcome.**

This is my technical documentation portfolio, a space I use to practice Technical
Writing as I continue to self-teach and grow in the field. I‚Äôve included sample
docs that reflect how I approach making complex topics more clear and
approachable. My background is in SaaS enablement, where I worked as a Senior
Instructional Designer, and I‚Äôm now shifting into Technical Writing with a focus
on clarity, usability, and real-world impact.

## üìÇ Portfolio Contents

Here, you'll find examples of my work across several documentation types, including:

- [**User Guides & Tutorials**](./User-Guides): Step-by-step instructions for technical products  
- [**API Documentation**](./API-Documentation): Clear reference documentation for developers  
- [**Knowledge Base Articles**](./Knowledge-Base): Concise solutions to common technical problems  
- [**Training Materials**](./Training-Materials): Educational content for technical product users

Each folder includes a landing page and sample documentation to demonstrate various
writing styles and use cases. These reflect my experience creating technical
enablement content that supports product adoption and reduces support needs.

## üîç About These Samples

The documents in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to:

- Organize complex information in a user-friendly way
- Create clear, concise technical instructions
- Design documentation for different audience needs
- Apply consistent formatting and terminology
