**Hi there — and welcome.**

This is my technical documentation portfolio, a space I use to practice technical writing as I continue to self-teach and grow in the field. I've included sample docs that reflect how I approach making complex topics more clear and approachable. My background is in SaaS enablement, where I worked as a Senior Instructional Designer, with a strong passion to explore Technical Writing.

## 📂 Portfolio Contents

Here, you'll find examples of my work across several documentation types, including:

- [**User Guides & Tutorials**](./User-Guides): Step-by-step instructions for technical products  
- [**API Documentation**](./API-Documentation): Clear reference documentation for developers  
- [**Knowledge Base Articles**](./Knowledge-Base): Concise solutions to common technical problems  
- [**Training Materials**](./Training-Materials): Educational content for technical product users

Each folder includes a landing page and sample documentation to demonstrate various writing styles and use cases. These reflect my experience creating technical enablement content that supports product adoption and reduces support needs.
