# Hello, I'm Corey Rollins üëã

I'm a Senior Instructional Designer with extensive experience in SaaS enablement, currently exploring technical writing and documentation. This GitHub houses my Technical Writing Portfolio, where I practice creating clear, accessible content that transforms complex technical concepts into user-friendly documentation.

### What You'll Find Here

My repositories showcase documentation in various formats including Markdown, structured user guides, API references, and knowledge base articles. I'm particularly interested in documentation-as-code practices and creating developer-friendly content.
