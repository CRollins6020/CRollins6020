# Hello, I'm Corey Rollins üëã

I'm a Senior Instructional Designer with extensive experience in SaaS enablement, currently exploring technical writing and documentation. I excel at transforming complex technical concepts into clear, accessible content that helps users navigate technology with confidence.

## About This Repository

This repository houses my **Technical Writing Portfolio** ‚Äî documentation that's **clear without oversimplification, comprehensive without overwhelming, and memorable without gimmicks**. I craft technical content that respects both the complexity of the subject and the reader's need for accessibility.
